<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Latin America is rich in water, but its water is unevenly distributed, with many cities at-risk for scarcity and floods. Water is needed for people, development and wildlife, and must be managed efficiently for sustainable growth.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>The Council is mobilizing business and political leaders to help secure clean water for Latin America's 25 most at-risk cities. Water management must be improved to increase water security, using nature-based solutions upstream to enhance water quantity and quality for downstream users.</p>
<p><strong>The big idea</strong>: Water Funds generate significant investment flows for upstream watershed management - protecting forests and other vital habitats - to provide an often cheaper way for cities to secure their water supplies. The water sector, governments and voters can see that protecting and restoring "green infrastructure" makes sense to complement "gray" infrastructure - pipes, dams, filtration plants and reservoirs. "</p>
<p>By pursuing the strategies and actions listed below, the Council aims to measurably improve water security for as many as 100 million Latin Americans by the year 2025, benefiting upstream communities and protecting and restoring millions of hectares of forests and grasslands that feed water to our cities.</p>
