<p>Demand for Latin America's mineral, agricultural and energy wealth is fueling regional growth. Poverty is falling, social indices are rising, and regional GDP is predicted to double in a decade. But natural ecosystems must be conserved, along with the services they provide to society, for regional development to endure.</p>

<p>Into this reality the Latin America Conservation Council was born in 2011. Council Members are leveraging their collective expertise, influence and resources to help conserve Latin America's "natural capital" - its healthy rivers, forests and seas - and to develop innovative, pragmatic and scalable solutions to three widespread environmental challenges: Water Security, Sustainable Food Security and Smart Infrastructure.</p>
<p>Working with civil society, government and the private sector, the Council calls for the region to become "best in class" in caring for nature, while providing for people. <strong>The time for action is now.</strong></p>

<p>The Council works in partnership with <a href="http://www.nature.org/">The Nature Conservancy</a>, the world's largest conservation organization.</p>
